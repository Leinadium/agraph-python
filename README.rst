AllegroGraph Python API
=======================
The AllegroGraph Python API offers convenient and efficient access to
an AllegroGraph server from a Python-based application. This API
provides methods for creating, querying and maintaining RDF data, and
for managing the stored triples. The AllegroGraph Python API
deliberately emulates the Aduna Sesame API to make it easier to
migrate from Sesame to AllegroGraph. The AllegroGraph Python API has
also been extended in ways that make it easier and more intuitive than
the Sesame API.
